    The ongoing AE: Artificial Emotions project sets out to develop a robot capable of creating drawings based on human
    emotions. The project envisages the harnessing of human self-expression and the visual language communication
    capabilities of robots. The primary purpose of this effort is to explore the potential benefits of a human/robot
    creative collaboration on mental health and well being.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Background: The Benefits of Human Self-Expression through Drawing. </p>

  <p>
    Drawing is a fundamental form of human expression with deep-rooted psychological benefits.
    It serves as a powerful tool for individuals to externalise and communicate their thoughts and
    emotions, fostering self-awareness and emotional well-being. Artistic expression, including
    drawing, has been linked to stress reduction, improved mood, and enhanced cognitive abilities.
    In our rapidly advancing technological landscape, society is increasingly recognising the
    importance of emotional well-being. The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and mental health issues
    highlights the need for innovative approaches that leverage technology to enhance emotional
    expression and self-awareness.

  </p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">EXTERNAL INTERPRETATION:</p>
  <p>A third-party artist (robot), with their unique learned perspective, can provide an external
    interpretation of the individualâ€™s emotional state. This can lead to unexpected insights and
    representations that the individual might not have considered.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION BY PROXY</p>
  <p>The commissioned artist (robot) acts as a medium for the emotional expression of the individual.
    It allows the person to externalise and give form to their emotions through the eyes and hands of
    the robot, potentially enhancing the depth and richness of the artistic expression.</p>
